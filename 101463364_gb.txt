At GBC, the regular go to is a spanish restaurant on ground floor next to Subway. 
My favorite is the wrap. The pork is juicy and tender. 
At the beginning, I have difficult in ordering.
The server doesn't understand what I said. 
Then, my classmate taught me how to pronounce "wrap" properly. 
I can easily order the yummy wrap.
Also, I like the fries.
The fries in this restuarant is like the one in Costco.
